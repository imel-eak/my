            <p>Hello, how was your day? I really hope you had a great day everyday. I know, life is tough sometimes but please, don't worry. I always pray for you, may God bless you in every breathe and every step. This may sound cringe, but I really like you, well, quite a lot. I cannot predict the future but I hope we can always stick together. Even if we couldn't, I hope you will always find happiness, with or without me. I love you.<span class="heart">&#9829;</span></p>
